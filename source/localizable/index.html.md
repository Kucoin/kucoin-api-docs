# Getting Started

## Introduction 

Welcome to KuCoin trader and developer documentation. These documents outline exchange functionality, market details, and APIs.

APIs are separated into two parts: **REST API and Websocket feed.**

- The REST API contains four categories: **User(private) , Trade(private), Market Data(public), Others(public)**
- The Websocket contains two categories: **Public Channels and Private Channels**

Private APIs require authentication and provide access to placing orders and other account information. 

Websocket APIs provide market data , most of them are public.

# General
General information of KuCoin System and API.

# Matching Engine

## Order Lifecycle

Valid orders sent to the matching engine are confirmed immediately and are in the received state. If an order executes against another order immediately, the order is considered done. An order can execute in part or whole. Any part of the order not filled immediately, will be considered open. Orders will stay in the open state until canceled or subsequently filled by new orders. Orders that are no longer eligible for matching (filled or canceled) are in the done state.

## Self-Trade Prevention

The **Self-Trade Prevention** is **an option** (set as not-selected by default) in advanced settings. When you specify **STP** when placing orders, your order will not fill your other orders. On the contrary, if you did not choose **STP** in Advanced, your order might be filled by your own orders.

### DECREMENT AND CANCEL(DC)

**Market order is currently not supported for DC**. When two orders from the same user cross, the smaller order will be canceled and the larger order size will be decremented by the smaller order size. If the two orders are the same size, both will be canceled.

### CANCEL OLDEST(CO)

Cancel the older (resting) order in full. The new order continues to execute.

### CANCEL NEWEST(CN)

Cancel the newer (taking) order in full. The old resting order remains on the order book.

### CANCEL BOTH(CB)

Immediately cancel both orders.

# Sandbox
**Sandbox is the test environment**, used for testing API connection and web trading, and provides all the functionalities for exchanges. In sandbox, you could use fake funds for exchange tests. 
 
The login session and API key in sandbox environment are completely separated from the production environment. You may use the web interface in sandbox environment to create API key.  

Notice: After registering in sandbox environment, you will receive an amount of fake funds (BTC, ETH or KCS) automatically released by the system in your account. If you want to **trade**, please transfer assets from the  **main**  account to the  **trade** account. The funds are only for exchange test purpose and cannot be withdrawn.

Sandbox URLs for API test:

Website:
**[https://sandbox.kucoin.com](https://sandbox.kucoin.com)**

REST API:
**https://openapi-sandbox.kucoin.com**


# Rate Limit

When a rate limit is exceeded, a status of **429 Too Many Requests** will be returned.

When the rate limit is exceeded multiple times, your IP or account may be suspended. The time range is from 2 minutes to 7 days.

If you are a professional trader or market maker and need a higher limit, please describe your KuCoin account, usage and approximate trading volume and send email to [api@kucoin.com](mailto:api@kucoin.com).

###REST API###

# REST API

## Base URL

The REST API has endpoints for account and order management as well as public market data.

Base url is **https://api.kucoin.com**.  

Request URL needs to be determined by BASE and specific endpoint combination. 

## Endpoint

Each interface has its own endpoint, described by field **HTTP REQUEST** in the docs. 

For the **GET METHOD** API, the endpoint needs to contain the query parameters string.

e.g. For "[List Accounts](#accounts)", the default endpoint of this api is **/api/v1/accounts**. 
If you pass the "currency" parameter(BTC), the endpoint is  **/api/v1/accounts?currency=BTC** and the final request url is **https://openapi-v2.kucoin.com/api/v1/accounts?currency=BTC**.

# Request
All requests and responses are **application/json** content type.  

Unless otherwise stated, all timestamp parameters should in milliseconds. e.g. **1544657947759**

## Parameters

For **GET, DELETE** request, all query parameters need to be included in the request url. (**e.g. /api/v1/accounts?currency=BTC**)

For **POST, PUT** request, all query parameters need to be included in the request body with JSON. (**e.g. {"currency":"BTC"}**). **Do not include extra spaces in JSON strings.**

## Data Fields

All interfaces may add fields in the future, existing fields will not change, please pay attention to compatibility during programming.

## Errors

Errors to bad requests will respond with HTTP error code or system error code. The body will also contain a message parameter indicating the cause.

### HTTP error status codes

```
{
  "code": "400100",
  "msg": "Invalid Parameter."
}

```

Code | Meaning
---------- | -------
400 | Bad Request -- Invalid request format
401 | Unauthorized -- Invalid API Key
403 | Forbidden -- The requested is hidden for administrators only.
404 | Not Found -- The specified resource could not be found.

429 | Too Many Requests -- Exceeded the access frequency
500 | Internal Server Error -- We had a problem with our server. Try again later.
503 | Service Unavailable -- We're temporarily offline for maintenance. Please try again later.



###System error codes###

Code | Meaning
---------- | -------
400001 | Any of KC-API-KEY, KC-API-SIGN, KC-API-TIMESTAMP, KC-API-PASSPHRASE is missing in your request header
400002 | KC-API-TIMESTAMP Invalid -- Time differs from server time by more than 5 seconds
400003 | KC-API-KEY not exists

500000 | Internal Server Error -- We had a problem with our server. Try again later.

While http status code is 200, the error occurs when business failed, you can find api specific business error codes under api detail



## Success

A successful response is indicated by HTTP status code 200 and system code 200000. the success payload is as follows:

```
{
  "code": "200000",
  "data": "1544657947759"
}
```

The response may contain an optional data. If the response has a data it will be documented under each resource below.

## Pagination

KuCoin uses pagination for all REST requests which return arrays. Pagination allows for fetching results with the current page and is well suited for realtime data. Endpoints like /api/v1/trades, /api/v1/fills, /api/v1/orders, return the latest items by default. To retrieve more results subsequent requests should specify which direction to paginate based on the data previously returned.


### PARAMETERS ###

Parameter | Default | Description
---------- | ------- | ------
currentPage | 1 | Current request page.
pageSize | 50 | Number of results per request.The minimum pageSize is **10** and maximum is **500**.


### EXAMPLE
**GET /api/v1/orders?currentPage=1&pageSize=50**


# Types 

## Timestamps 

Unless otherwise specified, all timestamps from API are returned in **milliseconds**(e.g. **1546658861000**). Most modern languages and libraries will handle this without issues. 

But you need to be aware that the timestamps between **matching engine** and **order** system is nanosecond.

## Numbers 
Decimal numbers are returned as strings to preserve full precision across platforms. When making a request, it is recommended that you also convert your numbers to strings to avoid truncation and precision errors.

Integer numbers (like trade id and sequence) are unquoted.


# Authentication

## Generating an API Key

Before being able to sign any requests, you must create an API key via the KuCoin website. Upon creating a key you will have 3 pieces of information which you must remember:

* Key
* Secret
* Passphrase

The Key and Secret will be randomly generated and provided by KuCoin. The passphrase is filled in when you create the API, you can't recover it after forgot. You can only apply for the new API again. KuCoin stores the salted hash of your passphrase for verification.

## Permissions

You can restrict the functionality of API keys. Before creating the key, you must choose what permissions you would like the key to have. The permissions are:

* **General** - Allows a key general permissions. This includes all GET endpoints.
* **Trade** - Allows a key to create orders, as well as retrieve trade data. This includes POST /api/v1/orders and several GET endpoints.
* **Transfer** - Allows a key to transfer currency on behalf of an account, including deposits and withdraws. Enable with caution - API key transfers WILL BYPASS two-factor authentication.

Please refer to documentation below to see what API key permissions are required for a specific route.

## Creating a Request

All REST requests must contain the following headers:

* **KC-API-KEY** The api key as a string.
* **KC-API-SIGN** The base64-encoded signature (see Signing a Message).
* **KC-API-TIMESTAMP** A timestamp for your request.
* **KC-API-PASSPHRASE** The passphrase you specified when creating the API key.

## Signing a Message

```php
    <?php
    class API {
        public function __construct($key, $secret, $passphrase) {
          $this->key = $key;
          $this->secret = $secret;
          $this->passphrase = $passphrase;
        }

        public function signature($request_path = '', $body = '', $timestamp = false, $method = 'GET') {
          
          $body = is_array($body) ? json_encode($body) : $body; // Body must be in json format
          
          $timestamp = $timestamp ? $timestamp : time() * 1000;

          $what = $timestamp . $method . $request_path . $body;

          return base64_encode(hash_hmac("sha256", $what, $this->secret, true));
        }
    }
    ?> 
```

```python
    #Example for get balance of accounts in python
    
    api_key = "api_key"
    api_secret = "api_secret"
    api_passphrase = "api_passphrase"
    url = 'https://openapi-sandbox.kucoin.com/api/v1/accounts'
    now = int(time.time() * 1000)
    str_to_sign = str(now) + 'GET' + '/api/v1/accounts'
    signature = base64.b64encode(
        hmac.new(api_secret.encode('utf-8'), str_to_sign.encode('utf-8'), hashlib.sha256).digest())
    headers = {
        "KC-API-SIGN": signature,
        "KC-API-TIMESTAMP": str(now),
        "KC-API-KEY": api_key,
        "KC-API-PASSPHRASE": api_passphrase
    }
    response = requests.request('get', url, headers=headers)
    print(response.status_code)
    print(response.json())
    
    #Example for create deposit addresses in python
    url = 'https://openapi-sandbox.kucoin.com/api/v1/deposit-addresses'
    now = int(time.time() * 1000)
    data = {"currency": "BTC"}
    data_json = json.dumps(data)
    str_to_sign = str(now) + 'POST' + '/api/v1/deposit-addresses' + data_json
    signature = base64.b64encode(
        hmac.new(api_secret.encode('utf-8'), str_to_sign.encode('utf-8'), hashlib.sha256).digest())
    headers = {
        "KC-API-SIGN": signature,
        "KC-API-TIMESTAMP": str(now),
        "KC-API-KEY": api_key,
        "KC-API-PASSPHRASE": api_passphrase,
        "Content-Type": "application/json" # specifying content type or using json=data in request
    }
    response = requests.request('post', url, headers=headers, data=data_json)
    print(response.status_code)
    print(response.json())
```

The **KC-API-SIGN** header is generated by creating a sha256 HMAC using the secret key on the prehash string **timestamp** + **method** + **requestEndpoint** + **body** (JSON string, need to be the same as the parameters passed by the API) and **base64-encode** the output. The timestamp value is the same as the **KC-API-TIMESTAMP** header.

The method should be **UPPER CASE**.

For **GET, DELETE** request, the **requestEndpoint** needs to contain the query string. e.g. **/api/v1/deposit-addresses?currency=BTC**，the body is the request body string or omitted if there is no request body (typically for GET requests).

<aside class="notice">Remember to base64-encode the digest output before sending in the header.</aside>


```python
#Example for Create Deposit Address

curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -H "KC-API-KEY:5c2db93503aa674c74a31734" -H "KC-API-TIMESTAMP:1547015186532" -H "KC-API-PASSPHRASE:Abc123456" -H "KC-API-SIGN:7QP/oM0ykidMdrfNEUmng8eZjg/ZvPafjIqmxiVfYu4=" 
-X POST -d '{"currency":"BTC"}' http://openapi-v2.kucoin.com/api/v1/deposit-addresses

KC-API-KEY = 5c2db93503aa674c74a31734
KC-API-SECRET = f03a5284-5c39-4aaa-9b20-dea10bdcf8e3
KC-API-PASSPHRASE = Abc123456

```

<aside class="spacer8"></aside>

## Selecting a Timestamp

The **KC-API-TIMESTAMP** header MUST be number of **milliseconds** since Unix Epoch in UTC. Decimal values are allowed, e.g. 1547015186532. But you need to be aware that timestamp between match and order is **nanosecond**.

Your timestamp must be within **5 seconds** of the api service time or your request will be considered expired and rejected. We recommend using the time endpoint to query for the API [server time](/#time) if you believe there many be time skew between your server and the API servers.

# User

You need to sign the request to use the private user API.

# Accounts

For cryptocurrency withdrawal, KuCoin supports internal and external transaction fee deduction, which means when the balance in your main account is sufficient to support the withdrawal, the system will initially deduct the transaction fees from your main account. But if the balance in your main account is not sufficient to support the withdrawal, the system will deduct the fees from your withdrawal amount.

For example:

Suppose you are going to withdraw 1 BTC from KuCoin platform (transaction fee: 0.0001BTC), if the balance in your main account is insufficient, the system will deduct the transaction fees from your withdrawal amount. In this case, you will be receiving 0.9999BTC actually.

## Cancel Withdrawal

Only withdrawals in processing status could be cancelled.


###HTTP REQUEST###

###Advanced Description###

###SYMBOL###

The symbol must match a valid trading symbol. The symbols list is available via the /api/v1/symbols endpoint.

###CLIENT ORDER ID###

The optional client_oid field must be a unique id (e.g UUID) generated by your trading application. This field value will be return in order detail. You can use this field to identify your orders in the public feed.

The client_oid is different than the server-assigned order id. You should record the server-assigned order_id as it will be used for future order status updates.

The server-assigned order id is also returned as the id field to this HTTP POST request.

<aside class="notice">Please do not repeat the setting of your client_oid and the max. size of the client_oid cannot exceed 40 English characters.</aside>

###TYPE###
When placing an order, you can specify the order type. The order type you specify will influence which other order parameters are required as well as how your order will be executed by the matching engine. If type is not specified, the order will default to a **limit** order.

**limit orders** are both the default and basic order type. A limit order requires specifying a **price** and **size**. The size is the number of bitcoin to buy or sell, and the price is the price per bitcoin. The limit order will be filled at the price specified or better. A sell order can be filled at the specified price per bitcoin or a higher price per bitcoin and a buy order can be filled at the specified price or a lower price depending on market conditions. If market conditions cannot fill the limit order immediately, then the limit order will become part of the open order book until filled by another incoming order or canceled by the user.

**market orders** differ from limit orders in that they provide no pricing guarantees. They however do provide a way to buy or sell specific amounts of bitcoin or fiat without having to specify the price. Market orders execute immediately and no part of the market order will go on the open order book. Market orders are always considered takers and incur taker fees. When placing a market order you can specify **funds** and/or **size**. Funds will limit how much of your quote currency account balance is used and size will limit the bitcoin amount transacted.

###STOP ORDERS###
Stop orders become active and wait to trigger based on the movement of the last trade price. There are two types of stop orders, stop loss and stop entry:

**stop: 'loss':** Triggers when the last trade price changes to a value at or below the stopPrice.

**stop: 'entry':** Triggers when the last trade price changes to a value at or above the stopPrice.

The last trade price is the last price at which an order was filled. This price can be found in the latest match message. Note that not all match messages may be received due to dropped messages.

Note that when triggered, stop orders execute as either market or limit orders, depending on the type. 

When placing a stop loss order, the system would pre-freeze the assets  in your account for the order. **When you are going to place a stop market order, we recommend you to specify the specific fund for the order when trading**.

###PRICE###
The price must be specified in priceIncrement symbol units. The priceIncrement is the smallest unit of price. For the BTC-USDT symbol, the priceIncrement is 0.00001000. Prices less than 0.00001000 will not be accepted, The price for the placed order should be a multiple number of priceIncrement, or the system would report error when you place the order. Not required for market orders.

###SIZE###
The size must be greater than the baseMinSize for the symbol and no larger than the baseMaxSize. The size must be specified in baseIncrement symbol units. Size indicates the amount of BTC (or base currency) to buy or sell.

###FUNDS###
The funds field is optionally used for market orders. When specified it indicates how much of the symbol quote currency to buy or sell. For example, a market buy for BTC-USDT with funds specified as 150.00 will spend 150 USD to buy BTC (including any fees). If the funds field is not specified for a market buy order, size must be specified and Kucoin will use available funds in your account to buy bitcoin.

A market sell order can also specify the funds. If funds is specified, it will limit the sell to the amount of funds specified. You can use funds with sell orders to limit the amount of quote currency funds received.

The funds must be greater than the quoteMinSize for the symbol and no larger than the quoteMaxSize. The size must be specified in quoteIncrement symbol units. Funds indicates the amount of USDT (or quote currency) to buy or sell.

###TIME IN FORCE###
Time in force policies provide guarantees about the lifetime of an order. There are four policies: Good Till Canceled **GTC**, Good Till Time **GTT**, Immediate Or Cancel **IOC**, and Fill Or Kill **FOK**.

**GTC** Good Till Canceled orders remain open on the book until canceled. This is the default behavior if no policy is specified.

**GTT** Good Till Time orders remain open on the book until canceled or the allotted cancelAfter is depleted on the matching engine. GTT orders are guaranteed to cancel before any other order is processed after the cancelAfter seconds placed in order book.

**IOC** Immediate Or Cancel orders instantly cancel the remaining size of the limit order instead of opening it on the book.

**FOK** Fill Or Kill orders are rejected if the entire size cannot be matched.

* Note, match also refers to self trades.

###POST ONLY###
The post-only flag indicates that the order should only make liquidity. If any part of the order results in taking liquidity, the order will be rejected and no part of it will execute.

### HIDDEN AND ICEBERG###

The **Hidden** and **iceberg Orders** are two **options** in advanced settings (note: the iceberg order is a special form of the hidden order). You may select “Hidden” or “iceberg” as the policy when placing a limit or stop limit order.

If you ticked “**Hidden**” when placing orders, your orders would be filled without being displayed on the orderbook. But please be noted that your order could still be viewed at the transaction history. 

Different from the hidden order, the **iceberg order**, as an special form of the hidden order, is divided into visible portion and invisible portion. When placing an iceberg order, you need to set the **visible size**. The maximum visible size for an iceberg order is 20 while the minimum visible size for it is 1/20 of the total order amount. 

**Note**: The minimum visible size shall be greater than the minimum order size.   

The visible portion of an iceberg order would be executed after being matched. After the execution, new portions of the iceberg order would come out until the order is fully filled.

**Note**: 1)The system would charge **taker fees** for **hidden** and **iceberg orders**.2)If both "iceberg" and "hidden" are selected, your order will be filled as an **iceberg order** by default.

###HOLDS###
For limit buy orders, we will hold price x size USDT. For sell orders, we will hold the number of Bitcoin you wish to sell. Actual fees are assessed at time of trade. If you cancel a partially filled or unfilled order, any remaining funds will be released from hold.

For market buy orders where funds is specified, the funds amount will be put on hold. If only size is specified, all of your account balance (in the quote account) will be put on hold for the duration of the market order (usually a trivially short time). For a sell order, the size in BTC will be put on hold. If size is not specified (and only funds is specified), your entire BTC balance will be on hold for the duration of the market order.

###SELF-TRADE PREVENTION###

The **Self-Trade Prevention** is **an option (set as not-selected by default)** in advanced settings. When you specify **STP** when placing orders, your order will not fill your other orders. On the contrary, if you did not choose **STP** in Advanced, your order might be filled by your own orders.

**Market order is currently not supported for DC**. When *timeInForce* is **FOK**, the stp flag will be forced to be specified as **CN**.

| Flag | Name                          |
| ---- | ----------------------------- |

###ORDER LIFECYCLE###
The HTTP Request will respond when an order is either rejected (insufficient funds, invalid parameters, etc) or received (accepted by the matching engine). A **200** response indicates that the order was received and is active. **Active** orders may execute immediately (depending on price and market conditions) either partially or fully. A partial execution will put the remaining size of the order in the open state. An order that is filled completely, will go into the **done** state.

Users listening to streaming market data are encouraged to use the order id field to identify their received messages in the feed.


###RESPONSE###
A successful order will be assigned an order id. A successful order is defined as one that has been accepted by the matching engine.

<aside class="notice">Open orders do not expire and will remain open until they are either filled or canceled.</aside>

## Cancel an order

```json
{
     "cancelledOrderIds": [
      "5bd6e9286d99522a52e458de"
    ]
}
```

Cancel a previously placed order.

You would receive the request return once the system has received the cancellation request. The cancellation request will be processed by matching engine in sequence. To know if the request is processed(success or not), you may check the order status or update message from the pushes.


### HTTP REQUEST ###
**DELETE /api/v1/orders/\<order-id\>**

### API KEY PERMISSIONS ###
This endpoint requires the **"Trade"** permission.

<aside class="notice">The <b>order id</b> is the server-assigned order id and not the passed clientOid.</aside>

### CANCEL REJECT ###
If the order could not be canceled (already filled or previously canceled, etc), then an error response will indicate the reason in the **message** field.

## Cancel all orders

```json
{
   "cancelledOrderIds": [
      "5c52e11203aa677f33e493fb",
      "5c52e12103aa677f33e493fe",

List your current orders.

### HTTP REQUEST
**GET /api/v1/orders**

### EXAMPLE
GET **/api/v1/orders?status=active** for retrieving all active orders

###API KEY PERMISSIONS###
This endpoint requires the **"General"** permission.

###PARAMETERS###
You can request for specific orders using query parameters.

Param | Type | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
status | string |*[optional]* **active** or **done**,  done as default, Only list orders for a specific status .
symbol |string|*[optional]* Only list orders for a specific symbol.
side | string | *[optional]* **buy** or **sell** 
type | string | *[optional]* **limit**, **market**, **limit_stop** or **market_stop** 
startAt | long | *[optional]* Start time. Unix timestamp calculated in milliseconds, the creation time queried shall posterior to the start time. 
endAt | long | *[optional]* End time.  Unix timestamp calculated in milliseconds, the creation time queried shall prior to the end time. 

<aside class="notice">This request is paginated.</aside>

###ORDER STATUS AND SETTLEMENT###
Orders which are resting on the order book, will be marked with the **active** status. Orders which are no longer resting on the order book, will be marked with the **done** status. There is a small window between an order being done and settled. An order is settled when all of the fills have settled and the remaining holds (if any) have been removed.

For order checking, after inputting the correct parameters, you could check the orders in all **status**. But if the **status** parameter is not input into the **orders** interface, the system would return the orders of **done** status to you by default.

When you query orders, there is no time limit for the **active** status of order. The order of the done status can only query data within time range of one week (the start and end time range cannot exceed 24*7 hours). If it exceeds one week, the system will prompt you exceed the time limit.If you pass the start time when querying orders and do not pass the end time, the system will automatically construct the end time as the start time + 24*7 hours, and vice versa.

The order history of cancel type will be saved for **one month**, after which you will not be able to query the cancel orders one month ago.

###POLLING###
For high-volume trading it is strongly recommended that you maintain your own list of open orders and use one of the streaming market data feeds to keep it updated. You should poll the open orders endpoint once when you start trading to obtain the current state of any open orders.

<aside class="notice">Open orders may change state between the request and the response depending on market conditions.</aside>

Get a list of recent fills.

###HTTP REQUEST###
**GET /api/v1/fills**

###API KEY PERMISSIONS###
This endpoint requires the **"General"** permission.

###PARAMETERS###
You can request fills for specific orders using query parameters.

Param | Type | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
orderId | string |*[optional]* Limit list of fills to this orderId（If you specify orderId, ignore other conditions） 
symbol | string |*[optional]* Limit list of fills to this symbol 
side | string |*[optional]* **buy** or **sell** 
type | string |*[optional]* **limit**, **market**, **limit_stop** or **market_stop** 
startAt | long |*[optional]* Start time. Unix timestamp calculated in milliseconds, the creation time queried shall posterior to the start time. 
endAt | long |*[optional]* End time. Unix timestamp calculated in milliseconds, the creation time queried shall prior to the end time. 

**Data time range**

You can retrieve data within time range of one week (default is latest week, the start and end time range cannot exceed 24*7 hours, 604800000 milliseconds). If it exceeds one week, the system will prompt you exceed the time limit.If you pass the start time when querying fills and do not pass the end time, the system will automatically construct the end time as the start time + 24*7 hours, and vice versa.

**Settlement**

The settlement contains two parts: 1) **Transactional settlement** and 2) **Fee settlement**. After an order is matched, the transactional and fee settlement data would be updated in the data store. Once the data is updated, the system would enable the settlement process and deduct the fees from your pre-frozen assets. After that, the currency would be transferred to the account of the user. 

**Fees**

With the leading matching engine system in the market, users placing orders on KuCoin platform are classified into two types: **taker** and **maker**. **Taker**s, as the taker in the market, would be charged with taker fees; while **maker**s as the maker in the market, would be charged with less fees than the taker, or even get maker fees from KuCoin （The exchange platform would compensate the transaction fees for you）. 

After placing orders on the KuCoin platform, to ensure the execution of these orders, the system would pre-freeze your assets based on the taker fee charges (because the system could not predict the order types you may choose). Please be noted that the system would deduct the fees from the orders entered the orderbook in advance.

If your order is market order, the system would charge taker fees from you.

If your order is limit order and is immediately matched and executed, the system would charge **taker fees** from you. On the contrary, if the order or part or your order is not executed immediately and enters into the order book, the system would charge **maker** **fees** from you if it is executed before being cancelled

After the order is executed and when the left order funds are **0**, the transaction is completed. If the remaining funds is not sufficient to support the minimum product (min.: 0.00000001), then the left part in the order would be cancelled.

If your order is a maker order, the system would return the left pre-frozen **taker** fees to you.

Notice: For a **hidden**/**iceberg** order, if it is not executed immediately and becomes a maker order, the system would still charge **taker fees** from you.

For example:

Take **BTC/USDT** as the trading pair, if you plan to buy **1 BTC** in market price, suppose the fee charge is **0.1%** and the data on the order book is as follows:

| Price（USDT） | Size（BTC） | Side |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---- |
| 4200.00       | 0.18412309  | sell |
| 4015.60       | 0.56849308  | sell |
| 4011.32       | 0.24738383  | sell |
| 3995.64       | 0.84738383  | buy  |
| 3988.60       | 0.20484000  | buy  |
| 3983.85       | 1.37584908  | buy  |

 When you placed a buy order in market price, the order would be executed immediately. The transaction detail is as follows:

| Price（USDT） | Size（BTC） | Fee（BTC） |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 4011.32       | 0.24738383  | 0.00024738 |
| 4015.60       | 0.56849308  | 0.00056849 |
| 4200.00       | 0.18312409  | 0.00018312 |

###LIQUIDITY###

**CURRENCY CODES**

Currency codes will conform to the ISO 4217 standard where possible. Currencies which have or had no representation in ISO 4217 may use a custom code.

Code | Description
--------- | -------  
BTC | Bitcoin
ETH | Ethereum
KCS | Kucoin Shares

For a coin, the "**currency**" is a fixed value and works as the only recognized identity of the coin. As the "**name**", "**fullnane**" and "**precision**" of a coin are values modifiable, when the "**name**" of a coin is changed, you should use "**currency**" to get the coin. 

For example:

The "**currency**" of XRB is "XRB", if the "**name**" of XRB is changed into "**Nano**", you should use "XRB" (the currency of XRB) to search the coin.

# Websocket Feed

REST API has a strict call frequency limit, Websocket is the most recommended and fastest way to get real-time data. 

<aside class="notice">The recommended way is to just create a websocket connection and subscribe to multiple channels.</aside>

## Apply connect token

```json
{
    "code": "200000",
    "data": {
        "instanceServers": [
            {
                "pingInterval": 50000,
                "endpoint": "wss://push1-v2.kucoin.net/endpoint",
                "protocol": "websocket",
                "encrypt": true,
                "pingTimeout": 10000
            }
        ],
        "token": "vYNlCtbz4XNJ1QncwWilJnBtmmfe4geLQDUA62kKJsDChc6I4bRDQc73JfIrlFaVYIAE0Gv2--MROnLAgjVsWkcDq_MuG7qV7EktfCEIphiqnlfpQn4Ybg==.IoORVxR2LmKV7_maOR9xOg=="
    }
}
```

You need to apply for a token to create a websocket connection. You only need to choose one of the below two tokens.

### Public token (No authentication required):

If you only use public channels（e.g. All public market data), please make request as follows to obtain the server list and temporary public token:

#### HTTP REQUEST

**POST /api/v1/bullet-public**

### Private channels (Authentication request required):

```json
{
    "code": "200000",
    "data": {
        "instanceServers": [
            {
                "pingInterval": 50000,
                "endpoint": "wss://push1-v2.kucoin.com/endpoint",
                "protocol": "websocket",
                "encrypt": true,
                "pingTimeout": 10000
            }
        ],
        "token": "vYNlCtbz4XNJ1QncwWilJnBtmmfe4geLQDUA62kKJsDChc6I4bRDQc73JfIrlFaVYIAE0Gv2--MROnLAgjVsWkcDq_MuG7qV7EktfCEIphiqnlfpQn4Ybg==.IoORVxR2LmKV7_maOR9xOg=="
    }
}
```

For request some additional private channels and messages (e.g. Account balance notice), please make request as follows after authorization to obtain the server list and authorized token.

#### HTTP REQUEST

**POST /api/v1/bullet-private**


### Response instanceServers

|field | description|
-----|-----
|pingInterval| Recommended to send ping interval in millisecond|
|pingTimeout| After such a long time(millisecond), if you do not receive pong, it will be considered as disconnected. |
|endpoint| Websocket server address for establishing connection|
|protocol| Protocol supported|
|encrypt| Indicate whether SSL encryption is used |

## Create connection

```javascript
var socket = new WebSocket("wss://push1.kucoin.com/endpoint?token=xxx&[connectId=xxxxx]");
```

When the connection is successfully established, the system will send a welcome message.


```json
{
  "id":"hQvf8jkno",
  "type":"welcome"
}
```

The connectId is connection id, a unique value taken from the client side. Both the id of the welcome message sent by system after the connection succeed as well as the id of the error message are connectId.

If you add the parameter below when creating the websocket connetcion:
**acceptUserMessage="true"**.
You will receive all private events (including their order changes, balance changes and login events).

<aside class="spacer2"></aside>

## Ping
```json
{
  "id":"1545910590801",
  "type":"ping"
}
```

To prevent the TCP link being disconnected by the server, the client side needs to send ping messages to the server to keep alive the link.

After the ping message is sent to the server, the system would return a pong message to the client side.

If the server has not received the ping from the client for **60 seconds**, the server will disconnect.

```json
{
  "id":"1545910590801",
  "type":"pong"
}
```
<aside class="spacer3"></aside>
## Subscribe

```json
{
    "id": 1545910660739,                          //The id should be an unique value
    "type": "subscribe",
    "topic": "/market/ticker:BTC-USDT,ETH-USDT",  //Topic needs to be subscribed. Some topics support to divisional subscribe the informations of multiple trading pairs through ",".
    "privateChannel": false,                      //Adopted the private channel or not. Set as false by default.
    "response": true                              //Whether the server needs to return the receipt information of this subscription or not. Set as false by default.
}
```

To subscribe channel messages from certain server, the client side should send subscription message to the server.

If the subscription succeed, the system would send ack messages to you. When the response is set as true.


```json
{
  "id":"1545910660739",
  "type":"ack"
}
```

While there are topic messages generated, the system would send the corresponding messages to the client side. For details about the message format, please check the definitions of topics.

### Parameters

#### id
Unique string to mark the request.

#### topic
The topic you want to subscribe to.

#### privateChannel
For some specific topics (e.g. /market/level3), **privateChannel** is available. The default value of **privateChannel** is **false**. If the **privateChannel** is set to **true**, the user will only receive messages related himself on the topic. The format of the **topic** field in the returned data is **{topic}:privateChannel:{userId}**.

#### response
If the response is set as true, the system would return the ack messages after the subscriptions succeed.

## UnSubscribe
Unsubscribe from topics you have subscribed to.

```json
{
    "id": "1545910840805",                            //The id should be an unique value
    "type": "unsubscribe",
    "topic": "/market/ticker:BTC-USDT,ETH-USDT",      //Topic needs to be unsubscribed. Some topics support to divisional unsubscribe the informations of multiple trading pairs through ",".
    "privateChannel": false, 
    "response": true,                                  //Whether the server needs to return the receipt information of this subscription or not. Set as false by default.
}
```

```json
{
  "id": "1545910840805",
  "type": "ack"
}
```

### Parameters

#### id
Unique string to mark the request.

#### topic
The topic you want to subscribe to.

#### privateChannel
For some specific **public** topics (e.g. /market/level3), **privateChannel** is available. The default value of **privateChannel** is **false**. If the **privateChannel** is set to **true**, the user will only receive messages related himself on the topic. The format of the **topic** field in the returned data is **{topic}:privateChannel:{userId}**.

#### response
If the response is set as ture, the system would return the ack messages after the unsubscription succeed.

## Multiplex

 In one physical connection, you could open different multiplex tunnels to subscribe different **topic**s for different data.

For example, enter command below to open **bt1** multiple tunnel :

 {"id": "1Jpg30DEdU", "type": "openTunnel", "newTunnelId": "bt1", "response": true}

Add “**tunnelId**” in the command: 

{"id": "1JpoPamgFM", "type": "subscribe", "topic": "/market/ticker:KCS-BTC"，"tunnelId": "bt1", "response": true}

You would then, receive messages corresponded to id **tunnelIId**:  

{"id": "1JpoPamgFM", "type": "message", "topic": "/market/ticker:KCS-BTC", "subject": "trade.ticker", "tunnelId": "bt1", "data": {...}}

To close the **tunnel**, you could enter command below: 

{"id": "1JpsAHsxKS", "type": "closeTunnel", "tunnelId": "bt1", "response": true}

##### Limitations

1. The multiplex **tunnel** is provided for API users only. 
2. The maximum multiplex tunnels available: **5**.


## Sequence Numbers
The sequence field exists in order book, trade history and snapshot messages by default and the level 3 and level 2 data works to ensure the full connection of the sequence. If the sequence is non-sequential, please enable the calibration logic.

## General Logic for Message Judgement in Client Side
1.Judge message type. There are three types of messages at present: message (the commonly used messages for push), notice (the notices general used), and command (consecutive command).

2.Judge messages by userId. Messages with userId are private messages, messages without userId are common messages.

3.Judge messages by topic. You could judge the message type through topic. 

4.Judge messages by subject. For the same type of messages with the same topic, you could judge the type of messages through their subjects.

}
```

Topic: **/market/level2:{symbol},{symbol}...**

Subscribe this topic to get Level2 order book data.

After the conducts, the system would send the increment change data pushed by websocket to you.

```json
{
  "type":"message",
  "topic":"/market/level2:BTC-USDT",
  "subject":"trade.l2update",
  "data":{
    "sequenceStart":1545896669105,
    "sequenceEnd":1545896669106,
    "symbol":"BTC-USDT",
    "changes":{
      "asks":[["6","1","1545896669105"]],           //price, size, sequence
      "bids":[["4","1","1545896669106"]]
    }
  }
}
```

Calibration procedure：

   1.After receiving the websocket l2update data flow, cache the data.

   2.Initiate REST (GET /api/v1/market/orderbook/level2_100?symbol=\<symbol\>) request to get the snapshot data of l2 order book.

   3.Playback the cached l2update data flow and find the sequence of the snapshot (range of location: sequence_start to sequence_end in l2update ). Discard all the l2update prior to sequence_start, then playback the change to snapshot.

   4.Put the new l2update data flow to the local snapshot to ensure that the sequence_start of the new l2update link up with the sequence_end of the previous l2update.

   5.Update the level2 full data based on sequence according to the size. If the price is 0, ignore the messages and update the sequence. If the size=0, update the sequence and remove the price of which the size is 0 out of level 2.  For other cases, please update price.



Subsequent updates will have the type l2update. The changes property of l2updates is an array with [price, size，sequence] tuples. Please note that size is the updated size at that price level, not a delta. A size of "0" indicates the price level can be removed.

**Example**

Take BTC/USDT as an example, suppose the current order book data in level 2 is as follows:

After subscribing the channel, you would receive changes as follows:

"asks":[

  ["3988.62","8", 15],

  ["3988.61","0", 18],

  ["3988.59","3", 16],

]

"bids":[

  ["3988.50", "44", "17"]

]

<aside class="notice">Description: the message format is [Price, Size, Sequence].</aside>

Get the snapshot of the order book through **REST** request ([Get Order Book](#get-part-order-book-aggregated)) to build a local order book. Suppose we get the data as follows:

Sequence：**16**

Data：

"asks":[

  ["3988.62","8"],

  ["3988.61","32"],

  ["3988.60","47"],

  ["3988.59","3"],

]

"bids":[

  ["3988.51","56"],

  ["3988.50","15"],

  ["3988.49","100"],

  ["3988.48","10"]

]

The current data on local order book is as follows:

| Price   | Size | Side |
| ------- | ---- | ---- |
| 3988.62 | 8    | Sell |
| 3988.61 | 32   | Sell |
| 3988.60 | 47   | Sell |
| 3988.59 | 3    | Sell |
| 3988.51 | 56   | Buy  |
| 3988.50 | 15   | Buy  |
| 3988.49 | 100  | Buy  |
| 3988.48 | 10  | Buy  |

In the beginning, the sequence of your local order book is **16**. Discard the feed data of sequence below or equal to **16**, apply playback the sequence **[17,18]** to update the snapshot of the local order book. Now the sequence of your local order book is **18** and your local order book is up-to-date.

**Diff:**

1.**Update size of 3988.50 to 44 (Sequence 17)**

2.**Remove 3988.61 (Sequence 18)**

Now your current order book is up-to-date and final data is as follows:

| Price   | Size | Side |
| ------- | ---- | ---- |
| 3988.62 | 8    | Sell |
| 3988.60 | 47   | Sell |
| 3988.59 | 3    | Sell |
| 3988.51 | 56   | Buy  |
| 3988.50 | 44   | Buy  |
| 3988.49 | 100  | Buy  |
| 3988.48 | 10  | Buy  |

Topic: **/market/level3:{symbol},{symbol}...**

For this topic, **privateChannel** is available.

Subsribe this topic to fully get the updata data for orders and trades.

The full channel provides real-time updates on orders and trades. These updates can be applied on to a level 3 order book snapshot to maintain an accurate and up-to-date copy of the exchange order book.

<aside class="notice">Note: If you are maintaining a level 2 order book, please consider switching to the level 2 channel.</aside>

An algorithm to maintain an up-to-date level 3 order book is described below. Please note that you will rarely need to implement this yourself.

1. Send a subscribe message for the symbol(s) of interest and the full channel.
2. Queue any messages received over the websocket stream.
3. Make a REST request for the [full atomic order book](#get-full-order-book-atomic) from the REST feed.
4. Playback queued messages, discarding sequence numbers before or equal to the snapshot sequence number.
5. Apply playback messages to the snapshot as needed (see below).
6. After playback is complete, apply real-time stream messages as they arrive.

<aside class="notice">All open and match messages will always result in a change to the order book. Not all done or change messages will result in changing the order book. These messages will be sent for received orders which are not yet on the order book. Do not alter the order book for such messages, otherwise your order book will be incorrect.</aside>

The following messages(**RECEIVED, OPEN, DONE, MATCH, CHANGE**) are sent over the websocket stream in JSON format when subscribing to the full channel:


###RECEIVED###

```json
{
  "type":"message",
  "topic":"/market/level3:BTC-USDT",
